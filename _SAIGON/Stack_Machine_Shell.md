### SAIGON SMASH (Stack Machine Shell)

- Variables are defined in and manipulated in conventional programming languages. Subsequently, stack machine programming (SAIGON) adds graph grounding to the variables.

The paragraph above summarizes and perhaps oversimplifies a very complicated and significant breakthrough in computer programming. 

To illustrate, we begin by a detailed exploration on the concept of "stack machine shell" (SMASH) as shown by ...

The Unix shell that we are all familiar with dates back to the 1970s (Unix date!) The Forth programming language was launched in 1968. It remains a mystery as to whether the developers crossed path. 

The pipe in Unix shells,  from Forth perspective, is a one item stack. It is trivial, for all intents and purposes, to make any Unix shell a complete stack machine. dc, the Unix utility desktop calculator, is a stack machine complete with reverse Polish notation. Various Unix shells have array which can easily double as stack. Nevertheless, it seems RPN never found its way to any Unix shell. 

As the web becomes a ubiquitous infrastructure of computing systems, it makes more sense to implement the stack machine shell (SMASH) for the web, as we demonstrated in ...

As mobile devices took over the web as the next ubiquitous interface, it makes sense to implement SMASH on mobile devices. 

So we will do it with Android Kotlin / Java. A port to Swift iOS should not take more than a day by a competent programmer. 

SAIGON SMASH however is more than just a shell like a Unix shell. It is actually an extension of a program, any program written in any programming language chosen by the programmer. 

Conventional deployment cycle of a program typically includes edit-compile-test-deploy. SAIGON SMASH makes a program "open ended" by allowing the programmer(s) and users continue to "program (verb) the program (noun)" after it is compiled. 

One may argue, is SAIGON SMASH not the same as an interpreter like PHP, node.js or Python? Yes, it is. However, there exist many restrictions mobile platforms such as Android and iOS where these popular interpreter cannot be deployed. SAIGON SMASH overcomes these restrictions. 

Besides, SMASH allows the shell scripts to use the functions and data of the host program, which is not possible with conventional interpreters. 

The most important application of SMASH, however, is the implementation of Grounded Graph Variables (GGV). A programmer would edit a program source code in any programming language of choice as usual. A SMASH module is added to the program during compilation (or execution).  Any variable within the program is thus available to SMASH, which can add graph relationships to the variable concerned. 

In this way, theoretically all programs ever written by human programmers in any programming language can be modified incrementally by third parties using SAIGON Cloudias. 

We believe this could be the most significant breakthrough in AGI, with potential to achieve AGI within a year, given sufficient resources.

Also, distributed ownership of AGI, most important issue in class struggle.
