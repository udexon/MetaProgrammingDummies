## Metaprogramming and the Foundations of Arithmetic

Does the human mind conceive subtraction before addition, or vice versa?

We believe substraction is the primary operator, numero uno. It is employed in matching goals. A baby must know when to cry when hungry, and when to stop sucking milk when full. These are all goals. Addition is derived from subtraction, as its inverse. Addition is used when we need to know how much or how many more of another variable (quantity) are needed to match a goal, where more than one quantities (variables) are perceived by the mind.
